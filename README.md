Each college course must have multiple subjects, which in turn, contain one teacher and many students. Furthermore, the system must store the name, birthday, and salary of teachers. For the students, it must save the name, birthday, registration number and the student's grade in the subjects enrolled.

### Architecture:
* ASP MVC 5
* SQL Server using Entity Framework 6 and LocalDB
* AngularJS
* SignalR
